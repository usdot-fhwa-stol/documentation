<div class="textblock"><p >The CARMA platform consists of a collection of executable ROS nodes. Such architecture allows the system to be extensible, as the nodes can be distributed across multiple CPU hardware if necessary for processing power. It is built on the Kinetic version of ROS, using ROS Java for the majority of the components, while the current set of hardware drivers, the sensor fusion, and a couple of static libraries are built in C++. The system runs on Ubuntu 16.04 on a 64 bit processor.</p>
<p >Once a set of device drivers is present to interact with the specific host vehicle hardware the CARMA system’s Interface Manager will automatically search for and engage the appropriate drivers based on their reported device status. The remainder of the software will function independently of the hardware specifics.</p>
<p >Note that in this OSADP submission, some of the existing device driver code has been redacted to protect possible proprietary information related to vehicle hardware interfaces. This driver code can probably be provided to interested parties, in a case-by-case basis, by contacting the FHWA sponsor of this project. In the current version, the specific driver directories that have been withheld are: delphi_esr_driver, socketcan_bridge, socketcan_interface, srx_can_driver, srx_controller, srx_objects.</p>
<p >CARMA provides a Route component that reads a route definition file, which describes the route as a list of successive waypoints, each with several attributes. This route defines where the vehicle is to drive. Even though CARMA currently is limited to SAE level 1 automation, meaning longitudinal control only, it handles lateral information, such as lane position and turning requirements, in anticipation of level 2+ capabilities being added in the future.</p>
<p >There is a Sensor Fusion component that takes in data from whatever sensors are active on the vehicle and fuses it into a coherent picture of the vehicle’s environment to the best of its ability. The current version fuses forward object radar signals with position and speed data from neighbor vehicle Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) to provide a list of known neighbor vehicles and their relative locations and speeds, abstracting away the details of how any individual sensor is operating or what its data looks like.</p>
<p >Data from the Sensor Fusion primarily feeds the Roadway component, which translates neighboring object data, as well as data about the roadbed in the host vehicle’s vicinity, into a complete model of the host’s environment, all expressed in terms of the host’s route coordinate system. <br  />
 This expression of the environment allows straightforward computations by the Guidance component.</p>
<p >A Message component encodes and decodes radio messages (currently DSRC, per the SAE J2735 2016 standard) for incoming and outgoing communications with other vehicles and infrastructure entities.</p>
<p >The Guidance component provides all of the intelligence for deciding how the vehicle is to achieve its objective (follow the selected route). It provides facilities for planning a trajectory, which is a tactically sized portion of the route (typically 10s to 100s of meters long). <br  />
 Trajectories are represented as series of longitudinal and lateral maneuvers. <br  />
</p>
<p >Guidance also provides an API for third-party plugins that can use all of the available situational information to plan portions of a trajectory. In fact, trajectories are entirely planned by plugins, so CARMA contains several built-in plugins to perform the more fundamental aspects of trajectory planning. These built-in plugins will act as defaults to allow the vehicle to perform even if no third-party plugins are present.</p>
<p >Guidance contains an Arbitrator component that orchestrates the various plugins to make their contributions to a trajectory according to various priority rules. Once a trajectory plan is complete and validated, Arbitrator passes it on to the Trajectory Executor to read the maneuvers and translate them into specific commands for the vehicle to follow.</p>
<p >Guidance also contains components that enable V2V and V2I negotiation functionality. Negotiation is the process of interacting with other entities in the traffic system to enact cooperative behavior, attempting to satisfy the needs of each participant. Typically, negotiations will be carried out with DSRC communications using mobility messages created specifically to support CARMA negotiations.</p>
<p >The mobility message structure includes four message types, modeled after current J2735 structure, and are specifically used for communicating future intent.</p>
<p >Finally, the CARMA platform includes a user interface (UI) that is visible on a web browser. The intent is that the CARMA vehicle has a tablet computer mounted to its dashboard and connected to the guidance PC via Wi-Fi. The PC hosts the web server for this purpose. The UI allows the vehicle’s operator to select a route to drive, select which of the third-party plugins to activate, select what information to display on the tablet, and command the vehicle’s automated controls to engage. As an automated route is underway, the UI also displays a variety of status information to the operator, some of which is specific to each plugin, and some of which is generic to the system as a whole.</p>
<p >Once the CARMA software is installed onto the vehicle’s PC, it can be run from the web UI. There is a small Apache web server set up for the sole purpose of running the CARMA software from the tablet. </p>
